 * placed, the caption, the eval state visualizer, the resize handle etc.
 *
 * This class implements the default implementation for nodes. It should be
 * subclassed to override this default implementation. Use `intelli::style` for
 * predefined sizes of certain graphical components, such as the port size.
 *
 * To calculate where all components are places in respect to each other, use
 * the `innerRect`. This rect is soely used to organize the components. If the
 * `computeBoundingRect` or `computeShape` methods are not overriden, it is also
 * used for the bounding rect and the shape.
 *
 * To invalidate the cached geometry data use `recomputeGeometry`
